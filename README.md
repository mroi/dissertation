My Doctoral Thesis
==================

All material that makes up my dissertation is stored here. This includes SVG sources for 
figures, Veusz sources for plots, and the LyX file that compiles to the final document. Also 
available are the bibliography database and style, the written summary, and some tools for 
stylistic checking and a half-baked ePub export.

The workbench for conducting all experiments that led to the data in my thesis gets sourced 
in as a git submodule of the [ATLAS repository](https://github.com/TUD-OS/ATLAS). Everything 
is `make` automated, so all experiments will be re-run and all graphs re-generated 
automatically by way of a single toplevel `make`. [Scilab](http://www.scilab.org) is used 
for scientific calculations, [Veusz](http://home.gna.org/veusz/) will plot the figures.
